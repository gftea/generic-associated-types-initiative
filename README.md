## How Can I Get Involved?

* We are not looking for coding support at this time.
* You may wish to submit experience reports or participate in active discussions, however, please visit our [issues page](/issues).

If you'd like to participate be sure to check out any of our [open issues] on this repository.

We also chat in the `#wg-traits` stream on the [rust-lang Zulip], feel free to introduce yourself over there and ask us any questions you have.
