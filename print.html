<p>Extend traits by permitting associated types to have generic parameters (types, lifetimes).</p>
<p>This enables writing traits that capture more complex patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>an [<code>Iterable</code>] trait for collections that support an <code>iter</code> method, yielding references into themselves</li>
<li>a [<code>Mode</code>] trait</li>
</ul>
<p>It also provides the technical foundation of <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-fundamentals-initiative/explainer/async_fn_in_traits.html">async functions in traits</a> and <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/impl-trait-initiative/explainer/rpit_trait.html">return-position impl Trait in traits</a> (although this dependence is internal to the compiler and exposed to users).</p>
<ul>
<li>Concretely, extend associated types with generic parameters.</li>
<li>This makes it possible to write traits describing more complex patterns, e.g.
<ul>
<li>methods with arguments or return values that borrow from other arguments</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extend Rust traits to describe patterns that currently cannot be described...

<p>We are currently focused on stabilizing a <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> form of GATs in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709">rust-lang/rust#96709</a>. That's a long github thread, so this page summarizes the key points to understand.</p>

<li>Understanding GATs in general:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="./explainer.html">explainer</a> covers the design that is being stabilized in tutorial form.</li>
<li>The <a href="./design_patterns.html">design patterns</a> section covers ways that GATs used in the wild.</li>
<li>The <a href="./explainer/rough_edges.html">rough edges</a> section explains some of the ways GATs are currently difficult to use; the <a href="./shiny_future.html">shiny future</a> section contains speculation on how to address those.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issue-1225460272">stabilization report</a> lays the groundwork.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issuecomment-1129311660">summary comment</a> identified the core concerns. We have detailed them here in more depth, and provided some counterpoints:

<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>There is no question that GATs enable <a href="mvp/../design_patterns.html">new design patterns</a>. For the most part, these design patterns take the form of enabling a new kind of abstraction. For example, <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/many_modes.html">many modes</a> allows a trait that encapsulates a &quot;mode&quot; in which some other code will be executed; lacking GATs, this can only be done in simple cases. These new design patterns may <strong>locally</strong> improve the code, but, if it becomes commonplace to use more complex abstractions in Rust code bases, Rust code overall will become harder for people to understand and read. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issuecomment-1168643277">As burntsushi wrote:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complexity increase comes precisely from the abstraction power given to folks. By increasing the accessibility to that power, that power will in turn be used more frequently and users of the language will need to contend with those abstractions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>burntsushi continues (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's where we come to the contentious part of this perspective: <strong>a lot of people have real difficulty understanding abstractions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick Cameron also <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/complexity/">wrote a blog post</a> covering this theme. One of Nick's comments on Zulip points out that duplicated code in an API surface is annoying to maintain, but could be easier for consumers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/GATs.20and.20complexity/near/287854656">Nick Cameron</a>: I think the risk of features like GATs is that encourages smaller, more abstract APIs which are more satisfying for library authors but which are harder for the median user to comprehend. For a non-GAT example, consider Result and Option compared to a more abstract monadic type. The latter reduces code duplication in the library and perhaps permits more interoperability, but we prefer having separate Result and Option in Rust because for most users, it's easier to understand an API with concrete values and functions like Ok and unwrap, rather than abstract concepts like unit and bind.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-alternatives">What are the alternatives?</a></h2>
<p>Nobody is contending that the <a href="mvp/../design_patterns.html">design patterns</a> aren't addressing real problems, but they are contending that <strong>solving those problems with a trait-based abstraction may not be the right approach</strong>. So what are these alternatives? </p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, it's a &quot;slightly less convenient API&quot; (as in <a href="https://docs.rs/csv/latest/csv/struct.Reader.html#method.read_record">CSV reader</a>).</li>
<li>In others, the answer is some combination of macros and code generation. For example, the <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/many_modes.html">many modes</a> pattern was used to make parser combinators work better, but that could also be addressed via procedural macros and code generation.</li>
<li>In yet others, it's HRTB; the standard workaround for the <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/iterable.html"><code>Iterable</code></a> pattern is to write <code>for&lt;'c&gt; Iterate&lt;'c&gt;</code>, for example.</li>
<li>Finally, it is sometimes possible to workaround the lack of GATs by introducing runtime overhead. e.g., foregoing the optimizations that <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/many_modes.html">many modes</a> enabled, or using an enum, or a trait object.</li>

I dont understand why GATs are suddenly considered a problem when they are (IMO) a feature much less in danger of being misused than unsafe code or proc macros. Rust has empowerment literally in its one-sentence slurb: we give people powerful tools and all the help we can to use them, and we accept that this means some people will misuse them, and we do what we can (technically and socially) to mitigate the consequences of that.</p>

<p>GATs in their current form have some pretty <a href="mvp/../explainer/rough_edges.html">severe limitations</a>. These limitations block one of the most compelling use cases, lending iterators, and fixing that will require polonius (c.f. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92985">#92985</a>). Worse, these limitations are hard to convey to users: things just kind of randomly don't work, and it's not obvious that this is the compiler's fault (this is kind of a &quot;worst case&quot; for learnability, since it can trick you into thinking you don't understand the model, when in fact you do).</p>

<p>It all starts similarly: I have bunch of traits that return Vecs or something. Then I profile and see allocs in tight loops I cannot afford.

And I bet that every program written in rust are using these concepts and people there either don't care and put boxes in traits or write their own super niche fragile implementations to fit their needs. [..] I'd like to put some thought on the matter &quot;No one using GATs&quot; and &quot;GATs are just too complicated&quot; - it reminds me of generics discussions in Go.

<p>More generally, Rust's entire history has been one of taking complex features, exposing them, and sanding down the edges over time -- and sometimes stalling out for an extended period of time. And yet, it's hard to come up with an example where it would've been better to hold off on stabilization. Take async functions: when stabilized, they had many diagnostic rough edges, and still do. And yet, it's clearly good that they're available.</p>

<p>This suggestion stems from the concern that <a href="mvp/./concern-too-complex.html">GATs give rise to abstractions that are too complex</a>, combined with a recognition that the lack of lifetime GATs means that common patterns like <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/iterable.html"><code>Iterable</code></a> cannot be expressed, which leads to its own form of complexity.</p>
<p>The argument then is that we should stabilize lifetime GATs <em>only</em> and avoid types. This limits the kinds of patterns that GATs can be used for. Patterns that abstract over types, like <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/many_modes.html">many modes</a>, <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/pointer_types.html">pointer types</a>, or <a href="mvp/../design_patterns/generic_scopes.html">generic scopes</a>, should instead use alternatives, like code generation or macros.</p>

<p>Limiting things to types is actually its own kind of learnability hazard. Having to learn &quot;exceptions&quot; (e.g., this only works for lifetimes) rather than a uniform set of rules (everything can take type parameters) can be quite challenging, particularly when the motivation for those exceptions is simply that we don't want people to be able to express certain abstractions (versus, say, the limitations that motivate dyn-safety, which are that it is simply not possible to general compiled code).</p>

<p>To desugar <code>-&gt; impl Trait</code>, one must have the ability to write type-level GATs. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Convert {
    fn convert(&amp;self, c: impl Converter) -&gt; impl Display;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>would be translated to something like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Convert {
    type convert&lt;T: Converter&gt;: Display;
    fn convert&lt;T: Converter&gt;(&amp;self, c: T) -&gt; Self::convert&lt;T&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If we lose the ability to write type-only GATs, then we can no longer fully explain or desugar these more complex features, which is also its own learnability hazard (and gives some indication as to the expressiveness that is being lost).</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <em>generic</em> associated types are an extension that permit associated types to have generic parameters. This allows associated types to capture types that may include generic parameters that came from a trait method. These can be lifetime or type parameters.</p>
<p>To see why they are useful, we'll start by looking at the <code>Iterator</code> trait, which defines a single iterator over some items. This trait works great with plain associated types. We'll then consider how we could create an <code>Iterable</code> trait, that defines a collection that can be iterated many times -- this trait requires generic associated types.</p>
<h2 id="example-iterator"><a class="header" href="#example-iterator">Example: Iterator</a></h2>
<p>Associated types in a trait are used to capture types that appear in methods but are determined based on the impl that is chosen (i.e., by the type implementing the trait) rather than being specified from the outside. The simplest example is the <code>Iterator</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Because the <code>Iterator</code> trait defines the <code>Item</code> type as an associated type, that implies that every type which implements <code>Iterator</code> will also specify what sort of <code>Item</code> it generates.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine I have an iterator for items in a slice <code>&amp;'c [T]</code>...</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Iter&lt;'c, T&gt; {
    data: &amp;'c [T],
}

impl&lt;'c, T&gt; Iterator for Iter&lt;'c, T&gt; {
    type Item = &amp;'c T;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        if let Some((prefix_elem, suffix)) = self.data.split_first() {
            self.data = suffix;
            Some(prefix_elem)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>...the impl specifies that the type of this iterator is <code>&amp;'c T</code>.</p>
<h2 id="extending-to-iterable"><a class="header" href="#extending-to-iterable">Extending to Iterable</a></h2>
<p>Associated types are useful, but on their own they are often insufficient to capture the patterns we would like to write as a trait. Often, this occurs when the associated type wants to include data borrowed from <code>self</code> or some other parameter.</p>
<p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait is great, but if you write a generic function that takes an <code>Iterator</code>, that iterator can only be iterated over a single time. Imagine a function that wanted to iterate once to find a total count and then <em>again</em> to process each item, this time knowing the full count:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn count_twice&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(iterator: I) {
    let mut count = 0;
    for _ in iterator {
        count += 1;
    }

    // Error: iterator already used
    for elem in iterator {
        process(elem, count);
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Of course, most Rust types in the standard library have a method called <code>iter</code> that is exactly what we want (e.g., <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.iter"><code>[T]::iter</code></a>). Given an <code>&amp;'i self</code>, these functions return a fresh iterator that yields up <code>&amp;'i T</code> references into the collection. Because they take a <code>&amp;self</code>, they can be called as many times as we want. So, if we knew which kind of collection we had, we could easily write <code>count_twice</code> to take a <code>[T]</code> or a <code>HashMap&lt;T&gt;</code> or whatever. But what we if want to write it generically, so it works across <em>any</em> collection? That turns out to be impossible to do nicely with associated types.</p>
<p>To see why, let's try to write the code and see where we get a stuck. We'll start by defining an <code>Iterable</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterable {
    // Type of item yielded up; will be a reference into `Self`.
    type Item;

    // Type of iterator we return. Will return `Self::Item` elements.
    type Iter: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Item&gt;;


    fn iter&lt;'c&gt;(&amp;'c self) -&gt; Self::Iter;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But when we try to write the impl, we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl&lt;T&gt; Iterable for [T] {
    type Item = &amp;'hmm T;
    //           ^^^^ what lifetime to use here?

    type Iter = Iter&lt;'hmm, T&gt;;
    //               ^^^^ what lifetime to use here?

    fn iter&lt;'c&gt;(&amp;'c self) -&gt; Self::Iter {
        //       ^^ THIS is the lifetime we want, but it's not in scope!
        Iter { data: self }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}

<p>You see the problem? In the case of <code>Iterator</code>, the <code>Self</code> type was <code>&amp;'c [T]</code> and the <code>Item</code> type was <code>&amp;'c T</code>. Since both <code>'c</code> and <code>T</code> appeared at the impl header level, both of those generic parameters were in scope and usable in the associated type. But for <code>Iterable</code>, we still want to yield references like <code>&amp;'c T</code>, but <code>'c</code> is not declared on the impl -- it's specific to the call to <code>iter</code>. </p>
<p>The fact that the lifetime parameter <code>'c</code> is declared on the method is not just a minor detail. It is exactly what allows something to be iterated many times; that is, the thing we are trying to capture with the <code>Iterable</code> trait. It means that the borrow you get when you call <code>iter()</code> only has to last as long as this specific call to <code>iter</code>. If you call <code>iter</code> multiple times, they can be instantiated with distinct borrows. (In contrast, if <code>'c</code> were declared at the impl scope, the borrow would last across <em>all</em> calls to any method in <code>Iterable</code>.)</p>

<p>To express traits like <code>Iterable</code>, we can make use generic associated types -- that is, associated types with generic parameters. Here is the complete <code>Iterable</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

    // Type of item yielded up; will be a reference into `Self`.

<p>Let's walk through it piece by piece...</p>
<ul>
<li>We added a <code>'collection</code> parameter to <code>Item</code>. This represents &quot;the specific collection that the <code>Item</code> is borrowed from&quot; (or, if you prefer, the lifetime for which that collection is borrowed). </li>
<li>The same <code>'collection</code> parameter is added to <code>Iterator</code>, indicating the collection that the iterator borrows its items from.</li>
<li>In the <code>iter</code> method, the value of <code>'collection</code> comes from <code>self</code>, indicating that <code>iter</code> returns an <code>Iterator</code> linked to <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>Each associated type also has a <code>where Self: 'collection</code> bound. These bounds are required by the compiler -- if you don't add them, you will get a compilation error. As <a href="explainer/./explainer/required_bounds.html">explained here</a>, this is a compromise that is part of the GATs MVP to give us time to work out the best long-term solution.
<ul>
<li>The bound <code>where Self: 'collection</code> is called an <em>outlives bound</em> -- it indicates that the data in <code>Self</code> must outlive the <code>'collection</code> lifetime</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-the-trait"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-trait">Implementing the trait</a></h2>
<p>Let's write an implementation of this trait.

<h2 id="specifying-the-value-of-a-gat"><a class="header" href="#specifying-the-value-of-a-gat">Specifying the value of a GAT</a></h2>
<p>Given some type <code>T: Clone</code>, this function takes any <code>Iterable</code> that yields <code>&amp;T</code> references, clones them, and returns a vector of the resulting <code>T</code> values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn into_vec&lt;T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;impl for&lt;'a&gt; Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'a&gt; = &amp;'a T&gt;,

    let mut out = vec![];
    for elem in iterable.iter() {
        out.push(elem.clone());
    }
    out
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's look at this function more closely. The most interesting part is the type of the <code>iterable</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>iterable: &amp;impl for&lt;'a&gt; Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'a&gt; = &amp;'a T&gt;,

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This admittedly verbose syntax is a way of saying:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterable</code> is some kind of <code>Iterable</code> that, when iterated with some lifetime <code>'a</code>, yields up values of type <code>&amp;'a T</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>for&lt;'a&gt;</code> binder is a way of making this bound apply for any lifetime, rather than talking about some specific lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="applying-gats-to-a-specific-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#applying-gats-to-a-specific-lifetime">Applying GATs to a specific lifetime</a></h2>
<p>The previous example showed an iterable applied to any lifetime. It is also possible to give bounds for some specific lifetime. This function, for example, takes an <code>iterable</code> with lifetime <code>'i</code> and yields up the first element:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn first&lt;'i, T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;'i impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'i&gt; = &amp;'i T&gt;,
) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'i T&gt;
{
    iterable.iter().next()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The bound <code>impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'i&gt; = &amp;'i T&gt;</code> says &quot;when iterated with lifetime <code>'i</code>, the resulting reference is <code>&amp;'i T</code>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="bounding-a-gat"><a class="header" href="#bounding-a-gat">Bounding a GAT</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to specify that the value of a GAT meets some additional trait bound. For example, maybe wish to accept any <code>Iterable</code>, so long as its <code>Item</code> values implement <code>Send</code>. We can do that like so...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We are actively soliciting feedback on the design of this aspect of GATs. This section explains the current nightly behavior, but at the end there is note about the behavior we expect to adopt in the future.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common use for GATs is to represent the lifetime of data that is borrowed from a value of type <code>Self</code>, or some other parameter. Consider the <code>iter</code> method of the <code>Iterable</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterable {
    ...

    fn iter&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'a&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the argument <code>'a</code> that is given to <code>Self::Iterator</code> represents the lifetime of the <code>self</code> reference. However, by default, there is nothing in the definition of the <code>Iterator</code> associated type that links its lifetime argument and the <code>Self</code> type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Warning: For reasons we are in the midst of explaining,
// this version of the trait will not compile.
trait Iterable {
    type Item&lt;'me&gt;;

    type Iterator&lt;'me&gt;: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Item&lt;'me&gt;&gt;;

    fn iter&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'a&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If you try to compile this trait, you will find that you get an error. To make it compile, you have to indicate the link between <code>'me</code> and <code>Self</code> by adding <code>where Self: 'me</code>. This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/trait-bounds.html?highlight=outlives#lifetime-bounds">outlives bound</a> indicates the GATs can only be used with a lifetime <code>'me</code> that could legally be used to borrow <code>Self</code>. This version compiles:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterable {
    type Item&lt;'me&gt;
    where
        Self: 'me;

    type Iterator&lt;'me&gt;: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Item&lt;'me&gt;&gt;
    where
        Self: 'me;

    fn iter&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'a&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="why-are-these-bounds-required"><a class="header" href="#why-are-these-bounds-required">Why are these bounds required?</a></h2>
<p>Without these bounds, users of the trait would almost certainly not be able to write the impls that they need to write. Consider an implementation of <code>Iterable</code> for <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, assuming that there are no <code>where Self: 'me</code> bounds on the GATs:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl Iterable for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    type Item&lt;'c&gt; = &amp;'c T;
    type Iterator&lt;'c&gt; = std::vec::Iter&lt;'c, T&gt;;
    fn iter(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'_&gt; { self.iter() }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The problem comes from the associated types. Consider the <code>type Item&lt;'c&gt; = &amp;'c T</code> declaration, for example: for the type <code>&amp;'c T</code> to be legal, we must know that <code>T: 'c</code>. Otherwise, nothing stops us from using <code>Self::Item&lt;'static&gt;</code> to construct a reference with a lietime <code>'static</code> that may outlive its referent <code>T</code>, and that can lead to unsoundness in the type system. In the case of the <code>iter</code> method, the fact that it takes a parameter <code>self</code> of type <code>&amp;'c Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> already implies that <code>T: 'me</code> (otherwise that parameter would have an invalid type). However, that doesn't apply to the GAT <code>Item</code>. This is why the associated types need a where clause:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl Iterable for Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    type Item&lt;'c&gt; = &amp;'c T where Self: 'c;
    type Iterator&lt;'c&gt; = std::vec::Iter&lt;'c, T&gt; where Self: 'c;
    fn iter(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'_&gt; { self.iter() }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>However, this impl is not legal unless the trait <em>also</em> has a <code>where Self: 'c</code> requirement. Otherwise, the impl has more where clauses than the trait, and that causes a problem for generic users that don't know which impl they are using.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-i-learn-more"><a class="header" href="#where-can-i-learn-more">Where can I learn more?</a></h2>
<p>You can learn more about the precise rules of this decision, as well as the motivations, by visiting the <a href="explainer/../design-discussions/outlives-defaults.html">detailed design page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-requested"><a class="header" href="#feedback-requested">Feedback requested!</a></h2>
<p>The current compiler adds the future defaults as a <strong>hard error</strong> precisely so that we can get the attention of early users and find out if these where clauses pose any kind of problem. We are not sure yet what long term path is best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the required bounds altogether.</li>
<li>Remove the required bounds and replace them with a warn-by-default lint, allowing users to more easily opt out.</li>
<li>Add the required bounds by default so you don't have to write them explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are finding that you have a trait and impls that you believe would compile fine, but doesn't because of these where clauses, then we would like to hear from you! Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/generic-associated-types-initiative/issues/new/choose">file an issue</a> on this repository, and use the &quot;Feedback on required bounds&quot; template. In the meantime, there is a workaround described in the next section that should allow any trait to work.</p>
<h2 id="workaround"><a class="header" href="#workaround">Workaround</a></h2>
<p>If you find that this requirement is causing you a problem, there is a workaround. You can refactor your trait into two traits. For example, to write a version of <code>Iterable</code> that doesn't require <code>where Self: 'me</code>, you might do the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait IterableTypes {
    type Item&lt;'me&gt;;
    type Iterator&lt;'me&gt;: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Item&lt;'me&gt;&gt;;
}

trait Iterable: IterableTypes {
    fn iter&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Self::Iterator&lt;'a&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This is a bit heavy-handed, but there's a logic to it: the rules are geared around ensuring that the associated types and methods that appear together in a single trait will work well together. By separating the associated types from the function into distinct traits, you are effectively asserting that the associated types are meant to be used independently from the function and hence it doesn't necessarily make sense to have the where clauses derived from the method signature.</p>

<p>Now that we have defined an <a href="shiny_future/./iterable.html"><code>Iterable</code></a> trait, we can explore different ways to reference it.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-the-value-of-a-gat-1"><a class="header" href="#specifying-the-value-of-a-gat-1">Specifying the value of a GAT</a></h2>
<p>Given some type <code>T: Clone</code>, this function takes any <code>Iterable</code> that yields <code>&amp;T</code> references, clones them, and returns a vector of the resulting <code>T</code> values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn into_vec&lt;T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'_&gt; = &amp;T&gt;,
) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt;
where
    T: Clone
{
    let mut out = vec![];
    for elem in iterable.iter() {
        out.push(elem.clone());
    }
    out
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's look at this function more closely. The most interesting part is the type of the <code>iterable</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn into_vec&lt;T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'_&gt; = &amp;T&gt;,
//                                ^^    ^
//                                |     |
//                                |    Lifetime elided in output position
//                               Lifetime elided in input position          
) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Both <code>'_</code> and <code>&amp;T</code>-with-no-explicit-lifetime are examples of Rust's &quot;lifetime elision&quot; syntax. You're probably familiar with elision from functions like this one:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn pick(c: &amp;[T]) -&gt; &amp;T
//         ^        ^
//         |        |
//         |       Lifetime elided in output position
//        Lifetime elided in input position          
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Whenever lifetimes are elided in <em>input</em> position, it means &quot;pick any lifetime, I don't care&quot;. When they are elided in output position, it means &quot;pick a lifetime from the inputs, or error if that's ambiguous&quot;. For functions, you can use a named lifetime to make the connection more explicit:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn pick&lt;'c&gt;(c: &amp;'c [T]) -&gt; &amp;'c T
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In the same way, with GATs, we can use a named lifetime, bound with <code>for</code>, to make things more explicit:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn into_vec&lt;T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;impl for&lt;'c&gt; Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'c&gt; = &amp;'c T&gt;,
    //              -------               --     --
) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> notation here is meant to read like &quot;for any lifetime <code>'c</code>, <code>Item&lt;'c&gt;</code> will be <code>&amp;'c T</code>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="applying-gats-to-a-specific-lifetime-1"><a class="header" href="#applying-gats-to-a-specific-lifetime-1">Applying GATs to a specific lifetime</a></h2>
<p>The previous example showed an iterable applied to any lifetime. It is also possible to give bounds for some specific lifetime. This function, for example, takes an <code>iterable</code> with lifetime <code>'i</code> and yields up the first element:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn first&lt;'i, T&gt;(
    iterable: &amp;'i impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'i&gt; = &amp;'i T&gt;,
) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'i T&gt;
{
    iterable.iter().next()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The bound <code>impl Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'i&gt; = &amp;'i T&gt;</code> says &quot;when iterated with lifetime <code>'i</code>, the resulting reference is <code>&amp;'i T</code>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="bounding-a-gat-1"><a class="header" href="#bounding-a-gat-1">Bounding a GAT</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to specify that the value of a GAT meets some additional trait bound. For example, maybe wish to accept any <code>Iterable</code>, so long as its <code>Item</code> values implement <code>Send</code>. The <code>'_</code> notation we saw earlier can be used to do that quite easily:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn sendable_items&lt;I&gt;(iterable: &amp;I)
where
    I: Iterable,
    I::Item&lt;'_&gt;: Send, // 👈
{
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Using another nightly feature (<code>associated_type_bounds</code>, tracked in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52662">#52662</a>), you can also write the above more compactly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn sendable_items&lt;I&gt;(iterable: &amp;I)
where
    I: Iterable&lt;Item&lt;'_&gt;: Send&gt;, // 👈
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>

<p>A natural question with GATs is to ask &quot;what are they used for?&quot; Because GATs represent a kind of &quot;fundamental capability&quot; of traits, though, that question can be difficult to answer in a short summary -- they can be used for all kinds of things! Therefore, this section attempts to answer by summarizing &quot;design patterns&quot; that we have seen in the wild that are enabled by GATs. These patterns are described through a &quot;deep dive&quot; into a particular example, often of a crate in the wild; but they represent patterns that could be extracted and applied in other cases.</p>

<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Traits often contain methods that return data borrowed from <code>self</code> or some other argument. When the type of data is an associated type, it needs to include a lifetime that links with <code>self</code> from a calling method. For example, in the <code>Iterable</code> trait...</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterable {
    type Item&lt;'me&gt;
    where
        Self: 'me;

    type Iter&lt;'me&gt;: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Item&lt;'me&gt;&gt;
    where
        Self: 'me;

    fn iter(&amp;iter self) -&gt; Self::Item&lt;'_&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>...the <code>Item</code> and <code>Iter</code> traits take a <code>'me</code> parameter, which is linked to the <code>self</code> variable given when <code>iter</code> is called.</p>
<h2 id="details-1"><a class="header" href="#details-1">Details</a></h2>
<p>There are many variants on this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Iterable</code>, as shown above;</li>
<li><code>LendingIterator</code> (and other <code>LendingFoo</code>) traits, which permit one to iterate over items but where the data may be stored within the iterator itself;</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>where Self: 'me</code> shown in the summary is (hopefully) a temporary limitation imposed by the current MVP. It indicates that the <code>'me</code> lifetime can be used to borrow data from <code>Self</code>. Currently these where clauses are mandatory; they may be defaulted or made optional in the future.

<h2 id="workarounds"><a class="header" href="#workarounds">Workarounds</a></h2>
<p>Lacking this pattern, there are a number of common workarounds, each with downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>Box&lt;dyn&gt;</code> values, as in <a href="https://github.com/Emoun/graphene/issues/7">graphene</a>, though this adds dynamic dispatch overhead, inhibits inlining, and makes interactions with <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> more complex;</li>
<li>Return a collection, like a <code>Vec</code>, <a href="https://github.com/metamolecular/gamma/issues/8">as in metamolectular</a>, though this results in unnecessary memory allocation;</li>
<li>Use HRTB, as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_data_structures/graph/trait.WithSuccessors.html">rustc does</a>, which is complex and leaks into your caller's signatures.</li>

<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;many modes&quot; pattern is being able to take a single function and have it operate in multiple &quot;modes&quot;. In the specific case examined here, the chumsky parsing library, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issuecomment-1118409546">GATs were used</a> to make the parsing combinators generic over a mode (produce a result vs do not produce a result). This results in significant speedups, because producing a result when you don't need one is expensive at runtime.</p>
<p>To implement the &quot;many modes&quot; pattern, you often have a type representing each mode:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct ParseMode;
struct CheckMode;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>and then with a trait that defines the effect of that type. This trait often has associated types that can, e.g., transform the result of a function executing in that mode. This associate type takes a generic parameter <code>T</code> representing the return type of the function in question:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Mode {
    /// Represents the *actual* output when a function that produces 
    /// `T` is processed in this mode.
    type Output&lt;T&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="details-2"><a class="header" href="#details-2">Details</a></h2>
<p><em>This was originally posted as a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issuecomment-1167220240">comment on the issue thread</a>.</em></p>
<p>The first example I looked at closely was the <a href="design_patterns/">chumsky parsing library</a>. This is leveraging a pattern that I would call the &quot;many modes&quot; pattern. The idea is that you have some &quot;core function&quot; but you want to execute this function in many different modes. Ideally, you'd like to define the modes independently from the function, and you'd like to be able to add more modes later without having to change the function at all. (If you're familiar with Haskell, monads are an example of this pattern; the monad specifies the &quot;mode&quot; in which some simple sequential function is executed.)</p>
<p>chumsky is a parser combinator library, so the &quot;core function&quot; is a parse function, defined in the <code>Parser</code> trait. Each <code>Parser</code> trait impl contains a function that indicates how to parse some particular construct in the grammar. Normally, this parser function builds up a data structure representing the parsed data. But sometimes you don't need the full results of the parse: sometimes you might just like to know if the parse succeeds or fails, without building the parsed version. Thus, the &quot;many modes&quot; pattern: we'd like to be able to define our parser and then execute it against one of two modes, <em>emit</em> or <em>check</em>. The emit mode will build the data structure, but <em>check</em> will just check if the parse succeeds.</p>
<p>In the past, chumsky only had one mode, so they always built the data structure. This could take significant time and memory. Adding the &quot;check&quot; mode let's them skip that, which is a significant performance win. Moreover, the modes are encapsulated within the library traits, and aren't visible to end-users. Nice!</p>
<h3 id="how-did-chumsky-model-modes-with-gats"><a class="header" href="#how-did-chumsky-model-modes-with-gats">How did chumsky model modes with GATs?</a></h3>
<p>Chumsky added a <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait, encapsulated as part of their <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L67"><code>internals</code></a> module. Instead of directly constructing the results from parsing, the <code>Parser</code> impls invoke methods on <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> with closures. This allows the mode to decide which parts of the parsing to execute and which to skip. So, in check mode, the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> would decide not to execute the closure that builds the output data structure, for example.</p>
<p>Using this approach, the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L137"><code>Parser</code></a> trait does indeed have several 'entrypoint' methods, but they are all defaulted and just invoke a common implementation method called <code>go</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>Implementations of <code>Parser</code> <em>just</em> specify the <code>go</code> method. Note that the impls are, presumably, either contained within <code>chumsky</code> or generated by <code>chumsky</code> proc-macros, so the <code>go</code> method doesn't need to be documented. However, <em>even if <code>go</code> were documented</em>, the <em>trait bounds</em> certainly look quite reasonable. (The type of <code>inp</code> is a bit...imposing, admittedly.)</p>
<p>So how is the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait defined? Just to focus on the GAT, the trait look likes this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub trait Mode {
    type Output&lt;T&gt;;
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>T</code> represents the result type of &quot;some parser parsed in this mode&quot;. GATs thus allow us to define a <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> that is <strong>independent</strong> from any particular <code>Parser</code>. There are two impls of <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> (also internal to chumsky):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L115-L117"><code>Check</code></a>, defined like <code>struct Check; impl Mode for Check { type Output&lt;T&gt; = (); ... }</code>. In other words, no matter what parser you use, <code>Check</code> just builds a <code>()</code> result (success or failure is propagated inepdendently of the mode).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L87-L89"><code>Emit</code></a>, defined like <code>struct Emit; impl Mode for Emit { type Output&lt;T&gt; = T; ... }</code>.  In <code>Emit</code> mode, the output is exactly what the parser generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you could, in theory, produce other modes. For example, a <code>Count</code> mode that not only computes success/failure but counts the number of nodes parsed, or perhaps a mode that computes hashes of the resulting parsed value. Moreover, you could add these modes (and the defaulted methods in <code>Parser</code>) <strong>without breaking any clients</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-could-you-model-this-today"><a class="header" href="#how-could-you-model-this-today">How could you model this today?</a></h3>
<p>I was trying to think how one might model this problem with traits today. All the options I came up with had significant downsides.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple functions on the trait, or multiple traits.</strong> One obvious option would be to use multiple functions in the parse trait, or multiple traits:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Multiple functions
trait Parser { fn parse(); fn check(); }

// Multiple traits
trait Parser: Checker { fn parse(); }
trait Checker { fn check(); }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Both of these approaches mean that defining a new combinator requires writing the same logic twice, once for parse and once for check, but with small variations, which is both annoying and a great opportunity for bugs. It also means that if chumsky ever wanted to define a new mode, they would have to modify every implementation of <code>Parser</code> (a breaking change, to boot).</p>
<p><strong>Mode with a type parameter.</strong> You could try defining a the mode trait with a type parameter, like so...</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait ModeFor&lt;T&gt; {
    type Output;
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>go</code> function would then look like</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn go&lt;M: ModeFor&lt;Self::Output&gt;&gt;(&amp;self, inp: &amp;mut InputRef&lt;'a, '_, I, E, S&gt;) -&gt; PResult&lt;M, Self::Output, E&gt;
where
    Self: Sized;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In practice, though, this doesn't really work, for a number of reasons. One of them is that the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait includes methods like <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L74-L78"><code>combine</code></a>, which take the output of many parsers, not just one, and combine them together. Good luck writing that constraint with <code>ModeFor</code>. But even ignoring that, lacking HRTB, the signature of <code>go</code> itself is incomplete. The problem is that, given some impl of <code>Parser</code> for some parser type <code>MyParser</code>, <code>MyParser</code> only knows that <code>M</code> is a valid mode for its particular output. But maybe <code>MyParser</code> plans to (internally) use some other parser combinators that produce different kinds of results. Will the mode <code>M</code> still apply to those? We don't know. We'd have to be able to write a HRTB like <code>for&lt;O&gt; Mode&lt;O&gt;</code>, which Rust doesn't support yet:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn go&lt;M: for&lt;O&gt; Mode&lt;O&gt;&gt;(&amp;self, inp: &amp;mut InputRef&lt;'a, '_, I, E, S&gt;) -&gt; PResult&lt;M, Self::Output, E&gt;
where
    Self: Sized;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But even if Rust <em>did</em> support it, you can see that the <code>Mode&lt;T&gt;</code> trait doesn't capture the user's intent as closely as the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait from Chumsky did. The <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait was defined independently from all parsers, which is what we wanted. The <code>Mode&lt;T&gt;</code> trait is defined relative to some specific parser, and then it falls to the <code>go</code> function to say &quot;oh, I want this to be a mode for <em>all</em> parsers&quot; using a HRTB.</p>
<p>Using just HRTB (which, against, Rust doesn't have), you could define <em>another</em> trait...</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Mode: for&lt;O&gt; ModeFor&lt;O&gt; {}

trait ModeFor&lt;O&gt; {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>...which would allow us to write <code>M: Mode</code> on <code>go</code> against, but it's hard to argue this is <em>simpler</em> than the original GAT variety. This extra <code>ModeFor</code> trait has a &quot;code smell&quot; to it, it's hard to understand why it is there. Whereas before, you implemented the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait in just the way you think about it, with a single impl that applies to all parsers...</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl Mode for Check {
    type Output&lt;T&gt; = ();
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>...you now write an impl of <code>ModeFor</code>, where one &quot;instance&quot; of the impl applies to only one parser (which has output type <code>O</code>). It feels indirect:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl&lt;O&gt; ModeFor&lt;O&gt; for Check {

<h3 id="how-could-you-model-this-with-rpitit"><a class="header" href="#how-could-you-model-this-with-rpitit">How could you model this with RPITIT?</a></h3>
<p>It's also been proposed that we should keep GATs, but only as an implementation detail for things like return position impl Trait in traits (RPITIT) or async functions. This implies that we could model the &quot;many modes&quot; pattern with RPITIT. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/6a82f90ae4c1a4564e024eb0f63121fc7b7d3c18/src/zero_copy/mod.rs#L70"><code>Mode</code></a> trait, though, you'll see that this simply doesn't work. Consider the <code>combine</code> method, which takes the results from two parsers and combines them to form a new result:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn combine&lt;T, U, V, F: FnOnce(T, U) -&gt; V&gt;(

    y: Self::Output&lt;U&gt;,
    f: F,
) -&gt; Self::Output&lt;V&gt;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>How could we write this in terms of a function that returns <code>impl Trait</code>?</p>

<p>APIs like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scope.html"><code>std::thread::scope</code></a> follow a &quot;scope&quot; pattern:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>in_scope(|scope| {
    ... /* can use `scope` in here */ ...
})
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this pattern, the closure takes a <code>scope</code> argument whose type is somehow limited to the closure body, often by including a fresh generic lifetime (<code>'env</code>, in the case of [<code>std::thread::scope</code>]). The closure is then able to invoke methods on <code>scope</code>. This pattern makes sense when there is some setup and teardown required both/after the scope (e.g., blocking on all the threads that were spawned to terminate).</p>
<p>The &quot;generic scopes&quot; pattern encapsulates this &quot;scoped closure&quot; concept:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>owner.with_scope(|scope| {
    ...
})
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the type of the <code>scope</code> that the closure will depend on the <code>with_scope</code> call, but it needs to include some fresh lifetime that is tied to the <code>with_scope</code> call itself.</p>
<h2 id="details-3"><a class="header" href="#details-3">Details</a></h2>
<p>The generic scopes pattern arise from <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96709#issuecomment-1120354039">smithay</a> and was demonstrated by this <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=a23b6a846aa1a506c199f7792e1abd3e">playground</a>) snippet.</p>
<p>In this case, the &quot;owner&quot; object is a renderer, and the &quot;scope&quot; call is called <code>render</code>. Clients invoke...</p>

The conclusion was to adopt the most conservative route and <strong>require</strong> users to explicitly write a set of where clauses on associated types.

<p>...the method <code>iter</code> returns <code>&lt;Self as Iterable&gt;::Iter&lt;'s&gt;</code> (written in fully qualified form), and we have that <code>self: &amp;'s Self</code>.

</span>#![feature(generic_associated_types)]

<span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait X&lt;'a&gt; {
    type Y&lt;'b&gt;;
    fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Y&lt;'static&gt;;
})):
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Without the special case for <code>'static</code>, we would see that the return type includes</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>&lt;Self as X&lt;'a&gt;&gt;::Y&lt;'static&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>and then check that <code>'static: 'a</code> (it does, unsurprisingly), and hence conclude that we need to preserve that relationship by adding a <code>where 'b: 'a</code> clause to the associated type. But that where clause isn't likely to help any impls type check. In fact, the fact that <code>Self::Y&lt;'static&gt;</code> can be hard-coded into the trait signature suggests that, for all impls, the value of <code>Y</code> must either (a) not reference <code>'b</code> or else (b) only use <code>'b</code> as part of some ref <code>&amp;'b T</code> where <code>T: 'static</code>. So really there isn't much point to adding where-clauses relating <code>'b</code>. You <em>could</em> imagine that an impl might want to have <code>&amp;'a &amp;'b u32</code>, and to rely on the fact that <code>'b: 'a</code> in every case where it appears in the interface -- but right now, the only usage in the interface is <code>'static</code>, and so that same type could just be <code>&amp;'a &amp;'static u32</code>, which would work fine.</p>

<p>Well, we are pretty sure, because our algorithm is quite general. It essentially looks for any patterns or relationships between parameters found in the method signatures of the trait, modulo the carve-out for <code>'static</code> described in answer to the previous question. It's possible that we could find a source of relationships we haven't considered, or we could find that the carve-out masks something more common, but those seem unlikely, and regardless they would likely be quite obscure cases (and hence it may be possible to tweak the rules without affecting existing code, or tweak the rules in an edition).</p>
<h3 id="bounds-against-other-parameters"><a class="header" href="#bounds-against-other-parameters">Bounds against other parameters</a></h3>
<p>The required bounds sometimes relate to parameters on the trait itself, and not the GAT parameters:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub trait Get&lt;'a&gt; {
    type Item&lt;'c&gt;

    fn get(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Self::Item&lt;'static&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The reason for this is that the value of the <code>Item</code> type likely incorporates <code>'a</code> and <code>Self</code> and relies on the relationships of those types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

        &amp;self[0]
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="why-not-issue-default-bounds-against-other-associated-types"><a class="header" href="#why-not-issue-default-bounds-against-other-associated-types">Why not issue default bounds against other associated types?</a></h3>
<p>Hmm, good question! It turns out that the idea of default bounds <em>is</em> applicable beyond GATs. For example, you might have a trait</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Iterator&lt;'i&gt; {
    type Item;

    fn foo(&amp;'i self) -&gt; Self::Item;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>and the code could suggest that <code>type Item</code> wants a where-clause like <code>where Self: 'i</code>. After all, it will only be used in cases where <code>&amp;'i self</code> is valid type.</p>
<p>We actually tried to enable default bounds but found that it caused the compiler to fail to bootstrap. Interestingly the trait in question was found in gimli, and it turned out to be a case where the default bounds <em>weren't wrong</em>. They were expressing a lifetime relationship that the trait did require, but that relationship was being encoded on the trait in a different, arguably more roundabout way. The trait in question is the <a href="https://github.com/gimli-rs/object/blob/0a38064531fef4ddbaf93770a3551d333338980e/src/read/traits.rs#L24"><code>Object</code> trait</a>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// An object file.
pub trait Object&lt;'data: 'file, 'file&gt;: read::private::Sealed {
    ...
    type SectionIterator: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Section&gt;;
    ...
    fn sections(&amp;'file self) -&gt; Self::SectionIterator;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The error here suggested adding <code>where Self: 'file</code> to the <code>type SectionIterator</code>. Interestingly, if you look closely at the trait header, you can see that it is <code>'data: 'file</code>. This <code>'data</code> lifetime turns out to be the lifetime of data that appears in <code>Self</code>. So e.g. an <a href="https://github.com/gimli-rs/object/blob/0b76070f1281ebfad5b6b79c74f0c2508e5ee85c/src/read/coff/file.rs#L54">example impl</a> looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl&lt;'data, 'file, R&gt; Object&lt;'data, 'file&gt; for CoffFile&lt;'data, R&gt;
where
    'data: 'file,
    R: 'file + ReadRef&lt;'data&gt;,
{
    type Segment = CoffSegment&lt;'data, 'file, R&gt;;
    type SegmentIterator = CoffSegmentIterator&lt;'data, 'file, R&gt;;
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In other words, the default bound of <code>where Self: 'file</code> was correct, but was being managed in a more complex way by the trait -- i.e., by adding a special lifetime (<code>'data</code>) into the trait signature that reflects &quot;the lifetime of borrowed data in <code>Self</code>&quot;, and then relating that lifetime to <code>'file</code>. In fact, the entire <code>Object</code> trait in gimil looks like it probably wanted to be a GAT, roughly like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// An object file.
pub trait Object: read::private::Sealed {
    ...
    type SectionIterator&lt;'file&gt;: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Section&gt;
    where
        Self: 'file;
    ...
    fn sections(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::SectionIterator&lt;'_&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To my eyes, this is unquestionably a simpler trait (and it fits what will likely become a fairly standard pattern).</p>

<p>We are moving towards stabilizing GATs (tracking issue: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44265">#44265</a>) but there is one major ergonomic hurdle that we should decide how to manage before we go forward. In particular, a great many GAT use cases require a surprising where clause to be well-typed; this typically has the form <code>where Self: 'a</code>. In &quot;English&quot;, this states that the GAT can only be used with some lifetime <code>'a</code> that could've been used to borrow the <code>Self</code> type. This is because GATs are frequently used to return data owned by the <code>Self</code> type. It might be useful if we were to create some rules to add this rule by default. Once we stabilize, changing defaults will be more difficult, and could require an edition, therefore it's better to evaluate the rules now.</p>
<h2 id="i-have-an-opinion-what-should-i-do"><a class="header" href="#i-have-an-opinion-what-should-i-do">I have an opinion! What should I do?</a></h2>
<p>To make this decision in an informed way, <strong>what we need most are real-world examples and experience reports</strong>. If you are experimenting with GATs, for example, how often do you use <code>where Self: 'a</code> and how did you find out that it is necessary? Would the default proposals described below work for you? If not, can you describe the trait so we can understand why they would not work?</p>
<p>Of great use would be example usages that do NOT require <code>where Self: 'a</code>. It'd be good to be able to evaluate the various defaulting schemes and see whether they would interfere with the trait. Knowing the trait and a rough sketch of the impls would be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="background-what-where-clause-now"><a class="header" href="#background-what-where-clause-now">Background: what where clause now?</a></h2>
<p>Consider the typical &quot;lending iterator&quot; example. The idea here is to have an iterator that produces values that may have references into the <strong>iterator itself</strong> (as opposed to references into the collection being iterated over). In other words, given a <code>next</code> method like <code>fn next&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a mut self)</code>, the returned items have to be able to reference <code>'a</code>. The typical <code>Iterator</code> trait cannot express that, but GATs can:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait LendingIterator {
    type Item&lt;'a&gt;;

    fn next&lt;'b&gt;(&amp;'b mut self) -&gt; Self::Item&lt;'b&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this trait definition turns out to be not quite right in practice. Consider an example like this, an iterator that yields a reference to the same item over and over again (note that it owns the item it is referencing):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct RefOnce&lt;T&gt; {
    my_data: T    
}

impl&lt;T&gt; LendingIterator for RefOnce&lt;T&gt; {
    type Item&lt;'a&gt; where Self: 'a = &amp;'a T;

    fn next&lt;'b&gt;(&amp;'b mut self) -&gt; Self::Item&lt;'b&gt; {
        &amp;self.my_data
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the type <code>type Item&lt;'a&gt; = &amp;'a T</code> declaration is actually illegal. Why is that? The assumption when authoring the trait was that <code>'a</code> would always be the lifetime of the <code>self</code> reference in the <code>next</code> function, of course, but that is not in fact <em>required</em>. People can reference <code>Item</code> with any lifetime they want. For example, what if somebody wrote the type <code>&lt;SomeType&lt;T&gt; as LendingIterator&gt;::Item&lt;'static&gt;</code>? In this case, <code>T: 'static</code> would have to be true, but <code>T</code> may in fact contain borrowed references. This is why the compiler gives you a &quot;T may not outlive <code>'a</code>&quot; error (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=821e30ee635326a22fc19cd940bbaf62">playground</a>). </p>
<p>We can encode the constraint that &quot;<code>'a</code> is meant to be the lifetime of the <code>self</code> reference&quot; by adding a <code>where Self: 'a</code> clause to the <code>type Item</code> declaration. This is saying &quot;you can only use a <code>'a</code> that could be a reference to <code>Self</code>&quot;. If you make this change, you'll find that the code compiles (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=87cb2430ee76ece77499d3c6605874df">playground</a>): </p>

<p>If you were to implement <code>Parser</code> for some reference type (in this case, <code>&amp;'b Dummy</code>) you can now set <code>Output</code> to something that has no relation to <code>'b</code>:</p>

<p>Note that you would need a similar <code>where</code> clause if you were going to have a setup like:</p>

<h3 id="example-iter-static"><a class="header" href="#example-iter-static">Example: Iter static</a></h3>
<p>In the previous example, the lifetime parameter for <code>Output</code> was not related to the <code>self</code> parameter. Are there (realistic) examples where the associated type is applied to the lifetime parameter from <code>self</code> <em>but</em> the <code>where Self: 'a</code> is not desired?</p>
<p>There are some, but they rely on having &quot;special knowledge&quot; of the types that will be used in the impl, and they don't seem especially realistic. The reason is that, if you have a GAT with a lifetime parameter, it is likely that the GAT contains some data borrowed for that lifetime! But if you use the lifetime of <code>self</code>, that implies we are borrowing some data from <code>self</code> -- however, it doesn't <em>necessarily</em> imply that we are borrowing data of any particular type. Consider this example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Message {
    type Data&lt;'a&gt;: Display;

    fn data&lt;'b&gt;(&amp;'b mut self) -&gt; Self::Data&lt;'b&gt;;

    fn default() -&gt; Self::Data&lt;'static&gt;;
}

struct MyMessage&lt;T&gt; {
    text: String,
    payload: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Message for MyMessage&lt;T&gt; {
    type Data&lt;'a&gt;: Display = &amp;'a str;
    // No requirement that `T: 'a`!

    fn data&lt;'b&gt;(&amp;'b mut self) -&gt; Self::Data&lt;'b&gt; {
        // In here, we know that `T: 'b`
    }

    fn default() -&gt; Self::Data&lt;'static&gt; {
        &quot;Hello, world&quot;        
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here the <code>where T: 'a</code> requirement is not necessary, and may in fact be annoying when invoking <code>&lt;MyMessage&lt;T&gt; as Message&gt;::default()</code> (as it would then require that <code>T: 'static</code>).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the usage of <code>&lt;MyMessage&lt;T&gt; as Message&gt;::Data&lt;'static&gt;</code> doesn't appear inside the trait definition, although it is hard to imagine exactly how one writes a useful function like that in practice.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<h3 id="status-quo"><a class="header" href="#status-quo">Status quo</a></h3>
<p>We ship with no default. This kind of locks in a box, because adding a default later would be a breaking change to existing impls that are affected by the default. since some of them may be using the associated types with a lifetime unrelated to <code>Self</code>. Note though that a sufficiently tailored default would only break code that was going to -- or perhaps <em>very likely to</em> -- not compile anyhow.</p>
<h3 id="smart-default-add-where-self-a-if-the-gat-is-used-with-the-lifetime-from-self-and-extend-to-other-type-parameters"><a class="header" href="#smart-default-add-where-self-a-if-the-gat-is-used-with-the-lifetime-from-self-and-extend-to-other-type-parameters">Smart default: add <code>where Self: 'a</code> if the GAT is used with the lifetime from <code>&amp;self</code> (and extend to other type parameters)</a></h3>
<p>Analyze the types of methods within the trait definition. It a GAT is applied to a lifetime <code>'x</code>, examine the implied bounds of the method for bounds of the form <code>T: 'x</code>, where <code>T</code> is an input parameter to the trait. If we find such bounds on all methods for every use of the GAT, then add the corresponding default.</p>
<p>Consider the <code>LendingIterator</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait LendingIterator {
    type Item&lt;'a&gt;;

    fn next&lt;'b&gt;(&amp;'b mut self) -&gt; Self::Item&lt;'b&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Analyzing the closure body, we see that it contains <code>Self::Item&lt;'b&gt;</code> where <code>'b</code> is the lifetime of the <code>self</code> reference (e.g., <code>self: &amp;'b Self</code> or <code>self: &amp;'b mut Self</code>). The implied bounds of this method contain <code>Self: 'b</code>. Since there is only one use of <code>Self::Item&lt;'b&gt;</code>, and the implied bound <code>Self: 'b</code> applies in that case, then we add the default <code>where Self: 'a</code> to the GAT. </p>
<p>This check is a fairly simple syntactic check, though not necessarily easy to explain. It would accept all the examples that appear in this document, including the example with <code>fn default() -&gt; Self::Data&lt;'static&gt;</code> (in that case, the default is not triggered, because we found a use of <code>Data</code> that is applied to a lifetime for which no implied bound applies). The only case where this default behaves <em>incorrectly</em> is the case where all uses of <code>Self::Data</code> that appear within the trait need the default, but there are uses outside the trait that do not (I couldn't come up with a realistic example of how to do this usefully).</p>
<h4 id="extending-to-other-type-parameters"><a class="header" href="#extending-to-other-type-parameters">Extending to other type parameters</a></h4>
<p>The inference can be extended naturally beyond <code>self</code> to other type parameters. Therefore this example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Parser&lt;Input&gt; {
    type Output&lt;'i&gt;;

<p>would infer a <code>where Input: 'i</code> bound on <code>type Output&lt;'i&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>

<h4 id="avoiding-the-default"><a class="header" href="#avoiding-the-default">Avoiding the default</a></h4>
<p>If this default is truly not desired, there is a workaround: one can declare a supertrait that contains just the associated type. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait IterType {

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This workaround is not especially obvious, however.</p>
<h4 id="related-precedent"><a class="header" href="#related-precedent">Related precedent</a></h4>
<p>We used to require <code>T: 'a</code> bounds in structs:</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>but as of <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2093-infer-outlives.html">RFC 2093</a> we infer such bounds from the fields in the struct body. In this case, if we do come up with a default rule, we are essentially inferring the presence of such bounds by usages of the associated type within the trait definition.</p>
<h2 id="recommendation"><a class="header" href="#recommendation">Recommendation</a></h2>
<p>Niko's recommendation is to use the &quot;smart defaults&quot;. Why? They basically always do the right thing, thus contributing to <a href="https://rustacean-principles.netlify.app/how_rust_empowers/supportive.html">supportive</a>, at the cost of (theoretical) <a href="https://rustacean-principles.netlify.app/how_rust_empowers/versatile.html">versatility</a>. This seems like the right trade-off to me.</p>
<p>The counterargument would be: the rules are sufficiently complex, we can potentially add this later, and people are going to be surprised by this default when it &quot;goes wrong&quot; for them. It would be hard, but not impossible, to add a tailored error message for cases where the <code>where T: 'b</code> check fails.</p>

<p>The most obvious default is to add <code>where Self: 'a</code> to the where clause list for any GAT with a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>, but that seems too crude.

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The reason for this is that the value of the <code>Item</code> type likely incorporates <code>'a</code> and <code>Self</code> and relies on the relationships of those types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You may have noticed that <code>Item</code> didn't need to be a GAT at all here -- in fact, the same logic would apply to a trait with no lifetime parameters. However, adding the rules that users write the bounds explicitly after the fact is not backwards compatible. We found crates that would stop compiling, such as gimli:</p>
<p>https://github.com/gimli-rs/object/blob/0a38064531fef4ddbaf93770a3551d333338980e/src/read/traits.rs#L24</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

pub trait Object&lt;'data: 'file, 'file&gt;: read::private::Sealed {

    type SectionIterator: Iterator&lt;Item = Self::Section&gt;;
    // needs `Self: 'file`
    ...
    fn sections(&amp;'file self) -&gt; Self::SectionIterator;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Interestingly, if you look closely at the trait header, you can see that it is <code>'data: 'file</code>. This <code>'data</code> lifetime turns out to be the lifetime of data that appears in <code>Self</code>. So e.g. an <a href="https://github.com/gimli-rs/object/blob/0b76070f1281ebfad5b6b79c74f0c2508e5ee85c/src/read/coff/file.rs#L54">example impl</a> looks like this:</p>

{
    type Segment = CoffSegment&lt;'data, 'file, R&gt;;
    type SegmentIterator = CoffSegmentIterator&lt;'data, 'file, R&gt;;
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In other words, the default bound of <code>where Self: 'file</code> was correct, but was being managed in a more complex way by the trait -- i.e., by adding a special lifetime (<code>'data</code>) into the trait signature that reflects &quot;the lifetime of borrowed data in <code>Self</code>&quot;, and then relating that lifetime to <code>'file</code>. In fact, the entire <code>Object</code> trait in gimil looks like it probably wanted to be a GAT, roughly like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>To my eyes, this is unquestionably a simpler trait (and it fits what will likely become a fairly standard pattern).</p>

<p>This syntax will be removed. Although its capabilities could be useful, it is also quite confusing (the placement of the <code>where</code> is a subtle distinction), and not clearly needed.

<h3 id="but-isnt-it-inconsistent-with-other-trait-items-to-put-the-where-clauses-before-the-"><a class="header" href="#but-isnt-it-inconsistent-with-other-trait-items-to-put-the-where-clauses-before-the-">But isn't it inconsistent with other trait items to put the where clauses <em>before</em> the <code>=</code>?</a></h3>
<p>From one perspective, yes. One can view the value of an associated type as its &quot;body&quot;, and the where clauses typically come before the &quot;body&quot; of an item. Put another way, typically you can &quot;copy and paste&quot; the impl and then add some text to the end of each item to specify its value: but with this syntax, you have to edit the &quot;middle&quot; of an associated type to specify its value.</p>
<p>The analogy of an associated type value to a function body, however, is somewhat flawed. The value of an associated type needs to be considered part of the &quot;signature&quot;, or public facing, part of the impl. Consider: you can change the body of a function and be certain that your callees will still compile, but you cannot do the same for the value of an associated type.</p>
<p>Given this perspective, when you copy the associated type from the trait to the impl, you are &quot;completing&quot; the signature that was left incomplete by the trait. Moreover, to do so, you replace the <code>: Bound1 + Bound2</code> list (which constraints what kinds of types the impl might use) with a specific type, thus making it more specific.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-a-more-purely-syntactic-point-of-view-what-is-more-consistent"><a class="header" href="#what-about-a-more-purely-syntactic-point-of-view-what-is-more-consistent">What about a more purely syntactic point-of-view? What is more consistent?</a></h3>
<p>There is precedent that the placement of the where clause has less to do with the logical role that it plays and more to do with other factors, like whether it is followed by a braced list of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>With <code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt; where T: Ord { t: T }</code>, the &quot;body&quot; of the struct is its fields, and the where clause comes first.</li>
<li>But we write <code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt;(T) where T: Ord</code>, thus placing the &quot;body&quot; (the fields <code>(T)</code>) first and the where clause second. Moreover, we initially implemented the grammar <code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt; where T: Ord (T)</code> but this was deemed so obviously confusing that it was <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17904#issuecomment-58603749">changed with little discussion</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As further evidence that this syntax is inconsistent with Rust's traditions, placing the where clauses before the <code>= ty</code> makes it objectively hard to determine how to run rustfmt in a way that feels natural. rustfmt handles <code>where</code> by putting the <code>where</code> onto its own line, with one line per where clause. This structure works for existing Rust items because where clauses are always either following by nothing (tuple structs) or by a braced (<code>{}</code>) list of items (e.g., struct fields, fn body, etc). That opening <code>{</code> can therefore go on its own line. This <code>where</code> clause formatting does not work well with <code>=</code>.</p>
<p>The idea of having where clauses come at the &quot;end&quot; of the signature is also supported by the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0135-where.html#readability">original RFC</a>, which motivated where clauses in part by describing how they allow you to treat the precise bounds as &quot;secondary&quot; to the &quot;important stuff&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I may step aside from the &quot;impersonal voice&quot; of the RFC for a moment, I personally find that when writing generic code it is helpful to focus on the types and signatures, and come to the bounds later. Where clauses help to separate these distinctions. Naturally, your mileage may vary. - nmatsakis</p>

<p>As currently implemented, trait aliases have two distinct possible placements for where clauses, which effectively distinguishes between a <em>where clause</em> (which must be proven true in order to use the alias) and an <em>implied bound</em> (which is part of what the alias expands to). One can write:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo&lt;T: Debug&gt; = Bar&lt;T&gt; + Baz&lt;T&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>in which case <code>where X: Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code> is only legal if <code>Y: Debug</code> is known from some other place. This is roughly equivalent to a trait like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo1&lt;T: Debug&gt;: Bar&lt;T&gt; + Baz&lt;T&gt; { }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The clause <code>where X: Foo1&lt;Y&gt;</code> is also only valid when <code>Y: Debug</code> is known. This is in contrast to the &quot;supertraits&quot; <code>Bar&lt;Y&gt;</code> and <code>Baz&lt;Y&gt;</code>, which are implied by <code>X: Foo1&lt;Y&gt;</code> (&quot;supertraits&quot; are also sometimes called &quot;implied bounds&quot;).</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can include the where clause in the &quot;value&quot; of the trait alias like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait ReverseEq&lt;T&gt; = where T: PartialEq&lt;Self&gt;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>where X: ReverseEq&lt;Y&gt;</code> is equivalent to <code>Y: PartialEq&lt;X&gt;</code>. There is no &quot;equivalent trait&quot; for usage like this; the <code>T: PartialEq&lt;Self&gt;</code> effectively acts like a supertrait or implied bound.</p>
<p>Our decision was that this is a subtle distinction and that using the placement of the where clause was not a great way to make it.</p>
<h3 id="is-that-trait-alias-syntax-consistent-with-the-rest-of-the-language"><a class="header" href="#is-that-trait-alias-syntax-consistent-with-the-rest-of-the-language">Is that trait alias syntax consistent with the rest of the language?</a></h3>
<p>Not really. There are other places in the language that could benefit from a similar flexibility around implied bounds. For example, one could imagine wanting to have an associated type <code>T::MyType&lt;Y&gt;</code> where it is known that <code>Y: PartialEq&lt;T::MyType&lt;Y&gt;&gt;</code>, but this cannot be readily written with today's syntax:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait MyTrait {
    type MyType&lt;T&gt;: PartialEq&lt;T&gt;;
    //              ^^^^^^^^^ not what we wanted
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We decided that if we were going to offer that capability, we should find a way to offer it more generally, and hopefully with more clarity than putting the where clause before or after the <code>=</code>. As we have seen, where clauses for different kinds of items can be rather variable in their placement, so it is not clear that all users will recognize that distinction and understand it (many present in the meeting were surprised by the distinction as well).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the implied bounds proposal goes another way, turning most where clauses into implied bounds by default!</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-even-need-where-clauses-in-the-impl-anyway"><a class="header" href="#why-do-you-even-need-where-clauses-in-the-impl-anyway">Why do you even need where clauses in the impl anyway?</a></h3>
<p>Given that the where clauses appear in the trait, you might wonder why they are needed in the impl anyway. After all, the impl could just assume that the trait bounds are met when checking the value of the associated type for validity, making the whole issue moot.</p>
<p>This would however be inconsistent with other sorts of items, which do require users to copy over the bounds from the trait. Furthermore, we have discussed the idea of allowing impls to relax the bounds from those described in the trait if they are not needed in the impl -- this came up most recently in the context of allowing impls to forego the <code>unsafe</code> keyword for <code>unsafe fn</code> declared in the trait if the fn in the impl body is completely safe. This could then even be relied upon by people invoking the method who know the precise impl they will be using.</p>
<p>In short, this might be a reasonable choice to make, but we should make it uniformly, and it shuts down the direction of using the lack of bounds in the impl as a kind of signal.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-change-type-alias-notation-too"><a class="header" href="#why-not-change-type-alias-notation-too">Why not change type alias notation too?</a></h3>
<p>Top-level type aliases currently parse with the where clause before the <code>=</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>type Foo&lt;T&gt; where T: Ord = T;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If you try that above example, however, you will find that you get a warning: this is because the <code>where T: Ord</code> is completely ignored! This is an implementation limitation in the way the current compiler eagerly expands type aliases. Moving the placement of where clauses actually gives us an opportunity to change this behavior without breaking any existing code, which is nice. It will however require some kind of opt-in (such as a <code>cargo fix</code> run) to migrate existing code that uses where clauses in the &quot;ignored place&quot; to the new format.</p>

<p>Currently, we accept where clauses in top-level type aliases, but they are deprecated (warning) and semi-ignored:</p>
<pre><code>type StringMap&lt;K&gt; where
    K: PartialOrd
= BTreeMap&lt;K, String&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Under this proposal, this syntax remains, but is deprecated. The newer syntax for type aliases (with <code>where</code> coming after the type) would remain feature gated until such time as we enforce the expected semantics.</p>

<p>In this case, we must settle the question of how we expect it to be formatted (surely not as I have shown it above).</p>
