## ðŸš§ Warning: GATs are under construction ðŸš§

This section describes the current vision of "GATs how they will be". Unfortunately, many parts of this vision are not yet implemented. The following table summarizes the status of various parts of the GAT design. Note that things that are not yet stabilized are subject to change.

In general, the GAT feature is currently in a "minimum viable product" phase. That means that there are a number of places where the syntax is kind of clumsy, and more annotations are required than we would like to have. The explainer describes the feature that we are aiming to stabilize but you can see the [Future Directions](./explainer/future_directions.md) section for some notes on the kinds of changes we would like to make.

## Continue

The explainer is broken into sections:

* [Intro](./explainer/intro.md) covers the main concepts and explains the `Iterable` pattern.
* [MVP](./explainer/mvp.md) covers the current MVP that we are planning to stabilize.
* The [design patterns](./explainer/design_patterns.md) section covers major design patterns enabled by GATs.
