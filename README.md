## âš¡ Current focus: MVP âš¡

We are currently focused on stabilizing a **Minimum Viable Product** form of GATs in [rust-lang/rust#96709]. [Learn more here!](./mvp.md) You can learn more:

* The [explainer](./explainer.md) covers the design that is being stabilized, and the [rough edges](./explainer/rough_edges.md) section explains some of the ways it is currently difficult to use (see the [shiny future](./shiny_future.md) section for speculation on how to address those).
* The [design patterns](./design_patterns.md) section documents some of the ways GATs are used in the wild.
